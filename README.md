Dig21000 is a comprehensive dataset comprising 21,000 images of digit-based rotary meters captured in uncontrolled environments. The dataset combines images sourced from three open datasets available on the Roboflow platform Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0), alongside a substantial portion collected and curated independently. 
To ensure the high quality and diversity of the dataset, we conducted rigorous data cleaning to remove lots of duplicate and invalid samples. The cleaned images were integrated with independently collected images and randomly split into training and testing sets at a ratio of 6:1. This approach not only ensures the richness of the training set but also provides reliable testing data for model evaluation. The dataset includes images representing 10 digit categories (0â€“9). It is worth noting that the images in this dataset present significant challenges for recognition. These images are often affected by factors such as dirt, scale variations, motion blur, in-plane and out-of-plane rotations, reflections, shadows, and occlusions. These challenges obscure key features in the images, significantly increasing the difficulty of recognition and posing unique challenges for subsequent image processing and analysis.
